    "This project explores the use of Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) in language modeling. The primary objective is to build a neural network that learns word relationships and generates meaningful text sequences. The implementation is done using PyTorch, covering key aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as:\n",
    "* Tokenization & Indexing: Converting text into numerical representations.\n",
    "* Embedding Layers: Mapping words to dense vector representations for efficient learning.\n",
    "* Context-Target Pair Generation (N-grams): Structuring training data for sequence prediction.\n",
    "* Multi-Class Neural Network: Designing a model to predict the next word in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process includes optimizing the model with loss functions and backpropagation techniques to improve accuracy and coherence in text generation. By the end of the project, you will have a working FNN-based language model capable of generating text sequences.\n",

    "Perplexity is a measurement used to evaluate the effectiveness of language models or probability models. It provides an indication of how well a model predicts a sample of data or the likelihood of an unseen event. Perplexity is commonly used in natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, speech recognition, and language generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity is derived from the concept of cross-entropy loss, which measures the dissimilarity between predicted probabilities and actual probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Cross-Entropy Loss} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \\ln(p_i)$$\n",
    "The cross-entropy loss is calculated by taking the negative sum of the products of the true labels $y_i$ and the logarithm of the predicted probabilities $p_i$ over $N$ classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the exponential of the mean cross-entropy loss gives us the perplexity value.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Perplexity} = e^{\\frac{1}{N} \\text{Cross-Entropy Loss}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A lower perplexity value indicates that the model is more confident and accurate in predicting the data. Conversely, a higher perplexity suggests that the model is less certain and less accurate in its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity can be seen as an estimate of the average number of choices the model has for the next word or event in a sequence. A lower perplexity means that the model is more certain about the next word, while a higher perplexity means that there are more possible choices.\n"
